# CitiBike BikeSharing
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  We did that by taking August 2019 bike sharing data in NYC and used Pandas and Tableau to create a story using visualizations to pitch to our investors.

Our initial data file needed the Trip Duration changed to a Datetime Format so we did that by using Python and Pandas function to convert the data from an integer to a dateime datatype.
